âœ¨ I'm a full stack engineer. I'm passionate about using tech for good and creative expression. I am also an advocate for [early-career devs contributing to open-source projects](https://dev.to/janessatran/a-beginner-s-guide-to-contributing-to-open-source-4fen). 

I love creating things- with code, paint, yarn, guitar, words, anything really. I also love sharing my knowledge with others through [my blog](https://janessatran.com). When I'm not coding, you can find me running, playing with my cat, or playing the guitar. Ultimately, **curiousity is my compass!**
